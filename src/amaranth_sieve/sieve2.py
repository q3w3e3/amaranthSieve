# chain of 1000000 1 bit registers
# start at second position (flip first as 1 is not prime)
# store this pisiton to a 20 bit register (n)
# flip that bit
# move n positions along the chain
# flip this bit
# move again
# flip
# until at end of chain
# move to start of chain
# look for first set bit
# goto: store this pisiton to a 20 bit register (n)
